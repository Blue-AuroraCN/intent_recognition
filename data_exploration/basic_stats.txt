0     Studying   {'degree': 'Master's Student', 'personality': 'Introverted', 'country': 'United States', 'financial_status': 'Strained'}                               I spend twice as much time as others reading literature, but I still can't participate in class discussions. I feel like an academic 'mute,' and this sense of frustration is overwhelming me. What should I do?
1  Socializing  {'degree': 'Undergraduate', 'personality': 'Extroverted', 'country': 'United Kingdom', 'financial_status': 'Comfortable'}   My classmates all have various plans for the weekend, while I'm always alone in my dorm. I know I should go out and socialize, but I just can't take that first step. How can I reconcile this conflicting feeling of both longing and fear?

3    Commuting   {'degree': 'Undergraduate', 'personality': 'Extroverted', 'country': 'United States', 'financial_status': 'Comfortable'}  Every day, I spend over an hour on the crowded bus to get to school, watching the unfamiliar streets outside the window. I feel like a seed scattered randomly, unable to find soil to take root. When will I ever feel a sense of belonging?
4        Other  {'degree': 'Master's Student', 'personality': 'Introverted', 'country': 'United Kingdom', 'financial_status': 'Strained'}         I have to deal with heavy academic workloads while also worrying about next semester's tuition and rent. Every day begins with pressure. I feel like I've forgotten what it's like to truly relax. How can I break this vicious cycle?
